# Voronoi Minesweeper

Minesweeper game with a mathematic twist. This was done as part of a project with the [Sydney Javascript Study Group](http://www.meetup.com/Sydney-JavaScript-Study-Group/).

# Development

To work on this project, you'll need NodeJS.

You'll also need jspm:

```
npm install -g jspm
```

**Optional** Install a simple http server `npm install -g http-server`

Install local dependencies

```
jspm install
```

Serve the root directory as public (If you installed http-server then `http-server` in the root directory)
